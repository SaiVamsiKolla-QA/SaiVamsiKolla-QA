## 🎯 My Story

I'm a QA engineer with **7+ years** of experience testing across **P&C Insurance, FinTech, eCommerce, and Telecom**. I've worked with **Accenture, TELUS, Peace Hills Insurance, and Meta** — testing products used by millions.

**But here's the truth:** Most of my career involved manual and Guidewire testing. I realized that wasn't enough for where the industry is headed.

So in **October 2025**, I made a decision: **Go deep, not wide.** I'm spending 8 weeks mastering **Playwright automation with JavaScript/TypeScript** to transition into a modern SDET role.

This GitHub is my **learning in public** journey — raw, honest, and evolving.
